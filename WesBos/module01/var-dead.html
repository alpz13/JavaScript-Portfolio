		// Popular opinion #1
		// use const by default
		// only use let if rebinding is needed
		// var should never be used in ES6
		// 
		// 
		// Popular opinion #2
		// use var for top-level variables that are shared across many (especially larger) scopes.
		// use let for localized variables in smaller scopes
		// Refactor let to const only after some has been written and you are reasonable sure that you have got a case where there shouldn't be variable reassignment.
